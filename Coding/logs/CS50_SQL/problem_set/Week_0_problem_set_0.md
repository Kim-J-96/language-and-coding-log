## üß™ Practice Examples - WEEK O Problem Set 0 - 36 Views
- write a SQL query that a translator might take interest in: list, side by side, the Japanese title and the English title for each print Ensure the Japanese title is the first column, followed by the English title.

WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai' AND "english_title" LIKE "%river%";
```

- write a SQL query to count how many prints by Hokusai include ‚ÄúFuji‚Äù in the English title. Though all of Hokusai‚Äôs prints focused on Mt. Fuji, in how many did ‚ÄúFuji‚Äù make it into the title?
```sql
SELECT COUNT("english_title") FROM "views"
WHERE "english_title" LIKE "% Fuji %";
```
** ‚ÄúFuji‚Äù NOT  ‚ÄúMt.Fuji‚Äù

- write a SQL query to count how many prints by Hiroshige have English titles that refer to the ‚ÄúEastern Capital‚Äù. Hiroshige‚Äôs prints were created in Japan‚Äôs ‚ÄúEdo period,‚Äù referencing the eastern capital city of Edo, now Tokyo.
```sql
SELECT COUNT("english_title") FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hiroshige'
AND "english_title" LIKE "%Eastern Capital%";
```

- write a SQL query to find the highest contrast value of prints by Hokusai. Name the column ‚ÄúMaximum Contrast‚Äù. Does Hokusai‚Äôs prints most contrasting print actually have much contrast?
```sql
SELECT MAX("contrast") AS "Maximum contrast" FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai';
```

- write a SQL query to find the average entropy of prints by Hiroshige, rounded to two decimal places. Call the resulting column ‚ÄúHiroshige Average Entropy‚Äù.

SELECT ROUND(AVG("entropy"), 2) AS "Hiroshige Average Entropy" FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hiroshige';
```

- write a SQL query to list the English titles of the 5 brightest prints by Hiroshige, from most to least bright. Compare them to this list on Wikipedia to see if your results match the print‚Äôs aesthetics.
```sql
SELECT "english_title" AS "English title" FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hiroshige'
ORDER BY "brightness" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
** üî• LIMIT always comes at the end, like the cherry on top üçí

- write a SQL query to list the English titles of the 5 prints with the least contrast by Hokusai, from least to highest contrast. Compare them to this list on Wikipedia to see if your results match the print‚Äôs aesthetics.
```sql

WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai'
ORDER BY "contrast" ASC
LIMIT 5;
```
** ‚ùóÔ∏èfrom least to highest contrast‚ùóÔ∏è

- write a SQL query to find the English title and artist of the print with the highest brightness.
```sql
SELECT "english_title" AS "English title", "artist" FROM "views"
ORDER BY "brightness" DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- write a SQL query to answer a question of your choice about the prints. The query should:
Make use of AS to rename a column
Involve at least one condition, using WHERE
Sort by at least one column, using ORDER BY

  - Write a SQL query to list the English titles and brightness values of all prints by Hokusai that have a brightness greater than 0.5. Rename the english_title column to print_title and the brightness column to light_level. Sort the results by light_level from brightest to darkest.
```sql
SELECT "english_title" AS "print_title", "brightness" AS "light_level" FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai' AND "brightness" > 0.5
ORDER BY "brightness" DESC;
```

## üß™ Practice Examples - WEEK O Problem Set 0 - Normals
- write a SQL query to find the normal ocean surface temperature in the Gulf of Maine, off the coast of Massachusetts. To find this temperature, look at the data associated with 42.5¬∞ of latitude and -69.5¬∞ of longitude.
Recall that you can find the normal ocean surface temperature in the 0m column, which stands for 0 meters of depth!
```sql
SELECT "0m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = '42.5' AND "longitude" = '-69.5';
```

- write a SQL query to find the normal temperature of the deepest sensor near the Gulf of Maine, at the same coordinate above.
The deepest sensor records temperatures at 225 meters of depth, so you can find this data in the 225m column.
```sql
SELECT "225m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = '42.5' AND "longitude" = '-69.5';
```

- choose a location of your own and write a SQL query to find the normal temperature at 0 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters. You might find Google Earth helpful if you‚Äôd like to find some coordinates to use!
```sql
SELECT "0m", "100m", "200m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = '42.5' AND "longitude" = '-69.5';
```

- write a SQL query to find the lowest normal ocean surface temperature.
```sql
SELECT MIN("0m") FROM "normals";
```

- write a SQL query to find the highest normal ocean surface temperature.
```sql
SELECT MAX("0m") FROM "normals";
```

- write a SQL query to return all normal ocean temperatures at 50m of depth, as well as their respective degrees of latitude and longitude, within the Arabian Sea. Include latitude, longitude, and temperature columns. For simplicity, assume the Arabian Sea is encased in the following four coordinates:
20¬∞ of latitude, 55¬∞ of longitude
20¬∞ of latitude, 75¬∞ of longitude
0¬∞ of latitude, 55¬∞ degrees of longitude
0¬∞ of latitude, 75¬∞ degrees of longitude
```sql
SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "50m" FROM "normals"
WHERE ("latitude" BETWEEN 0 AND 20)
AND ("longitude" BETWEEN 55 AND 75);
```

- write a SQL query to find the average ocean surface temperature, rounded to two decimal places, along the equator. Call the resulting column ‚ÄúAverage Equator Ocean Surface Temperature‚Äù.
The equator‚Äôs ocean surface temperatures can be found at all longitudes between the latitudes -0.5¬∞ and 0.5¬∞, inclusive.
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG("0m"), 2) AS "Average Equator Ocean Surface Temperature" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" BETWEEN -0.5 AND 0.5;
```

- write a SQL query to find the 10 locations with the lowest normal ocean surface temperature, sorted coldest to warmest. If two locations have the same normal ocean surface temperature, sort by latitude, smallest to largest. Include latitude, longitude, and surface temperature columns.
```sql
SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "0m" AS "surface temperature" FROM "normals"
ORDER BY "0m", "latitude"
LIMIT 10;
```
- write a SQL query to find the 10 locations with the highest normal ocean surface temperature, sorted warmest to coldest. If two locations have the same normal ocean surface temperature, sort by latitude, smallest to largest. Include latitude, longitude, and surface temperature columns.
There are 180 whole degrees of latitude. 
```sql
SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "0m" AS "surface temperature" FROM "normals"
ORDER BY "0m" DESC, "latitude"
LIMIT 10;
```

- write a SQL query to determine how many points of latitude we have at least one data point for. (Why might we not have data points for all latitudes?)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ROUND("latitude")) FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" IS NOT NULL;
```

ORDER BY "first_name", "last_name";
```

WHERE "birth_state" = 'PA' AND "birth_city" = 'Pittsburgh'
ORDER BY "debut" DESC, "first_name", "last_name" ASC;
```

- write a SQL query to count the number of players who bat (or batted) right-handed and throw (or threw) left-handed, or vice versa.

```

- write a SQL query to find the average height and weight, rounded to two decimal places, of baseball players who debuted on or after January 1st, 2000. Return the columns with the name ‚ÄúAverage Height‚Äù and ‚ÄúAverage Weight‚Äù, respectively.
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG("height"), 2) AS "Average Height",
       ROUND(AVG("weight"), 2) AS "Average Weight"
FROM "players"
WHERE "debut" >= '2000-01-01';
```

- write a SQL query to find the players who played their final game in the MLB in 2022. Sort the results alphabetically by first name, then by last name.

WHERE "height" > (SELECT AVG("height") FROM "players")
ORDER BY "height" DESC, "first_name", "last_name";
```
