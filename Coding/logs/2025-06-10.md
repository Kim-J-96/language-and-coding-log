- write a SQL query to list the titles of all episodes in Cyberchase’s original season, Season 1.
SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "season" = 1;

- list the season number of, and title of, the first episode of every season.
SELECT "season", "title" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "episode_in_season" = 1;

- find the production code for the episode “Hackerized!”.
SELECT "production_code" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "title" = 'Hackerized!';

- write a query to find the titles of episodes that do not yet have a listed topic.
SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "topic" IS NULL;

- find the title of the holiday episode that aired on December 31st, 2004.
SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "air_date" = '2004-12-31';

- list the titles of episodes from season 6 (2008) that were released early, in 2007.
SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "season" = 6 AND "air_date" LIKE "2007%";

- write a SQL query to list the titles and topics of all episodes teaching fractions.
SELECT "title", "topic" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "topic" LIKE "%fractions%";

- write a query that counts the number of episodes released in the last 6 years, from 2018 to 2023, inclusive. You might find it helpful to know you can use BETWEEN with dates, such as BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'.
SELECT COUNT("episode") FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "air_date" BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';

- write a query that counts the number of episodes released in Cyberchase’s first 6 years, from 2002 to 2007, inclusive.
SELECT COUNT("episode") FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "air_date" BETWEEN '2002-01-01' AND '2007-12-31';

- write a SQL query to list the ids, titles, and production codes of all episodes. Order the results by production code, from earliest to latest.
SELECT "id", "title", "production_code" FROM "episodes" 
ORDER BY "production_code";

- list the titles of episodes from season 5, in reverse alphabetical order.
SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" 
WHERE "season" = 5 
ORDER BY "title" DESC;

- count the number of unique episode titles.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "title") FROM "episodes";

- Write a SQL query to find the titles of episodes that have aired during the holiday season, usually in December in the United States.
SELECT "title", "air_date" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "air_date" LIKE "20__-12-__";

- Write a SQL query to find, for each year, the first day of the year that PBS released a Cyberchase episode.
